    /// Slots performs **no element lifecycle management**. The consumer
    /// determines slot occupancy through the metadata values — for example,
    /// a Swiss-table hash map uses `0x80` for empty and `h2` hash bits
    /// for occupied.
    ///
    /// ## Consumer-Managed Element Lifecycle
    ///
    /// `Buffer.Slots` has no deinit for elements. Any consumer that
    /// initializes element slots must deinitialize them before releasing
    /// the buffer, typically via ``deinitialize(where:)``.
    /// This is a capability boundary — the same contract as
    /// `Storage.Split`.
    ///
    /// ## No Growth
    ///
    /// Fixed-capacity. Consumers requiring growth must allocate a new
    /// `Buffer.Slots` and re-insert elements (e.g., hash table rehash).
